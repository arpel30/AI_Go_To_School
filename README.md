# AI Go To School
A genetic algorithm teaching AI avoiding obstacles.

- Genetic algorithm using reinforcement learning.

- The project is written in Java and the gui in JavaFx. 

- The user can control the speed of the learning simulation, the size of the population, and restart the Brains of the population.

- The user can save the current best Brain and load it whenever he would like, even in a new simulation.

- A graph describing the learning process is made concurrently to the simulation.
