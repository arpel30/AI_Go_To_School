# AI Go To School
An algorithm implementing Neural Networks behavior to teach AI avoiding obstacles.

- The algorithm is based on how Neural Networks learn, using reinforcement learning.

- The project is written in java and the gui in javafx. 

- The user can control the speed of the learning simulation, the size of the population, and restart the Brains of the population.

- The user can save the current best Brain and load it whenever he would like, even in a new simulation.

- A graph describing the learning process is made concurrently to the simulation.
